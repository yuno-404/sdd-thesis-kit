% Conclusion and future work example

This chapter-oriented workflow improves maintainability and reduces editing ambiguity in collaborative writing. Current limitations include sensitivity to abrupt distribution shifts and the need for deeper domain-specific tuning. Future work includes adaptive policy learning and broader validation on heterogeneous datasets.

From a writing-process perspective, the structure also shortens review cycles because each chapter can be revised independently while preserving global consistency through shared rules and checklists. A realistic next step is to connect experiment scripts and table generation to reduce manual transcription errors in result sections.
