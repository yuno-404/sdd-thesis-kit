# Spec Workflow for Thesis Writing

This repository includes a tool-agnostic spec structure for paper writing.

## Structure

- `specs/rules/writing-constraints.md`: canonical writing rules (source of truth)
- `specs/thesis-draft/requirements.md`: what must be true
- `specs/thesis-draft/design.md`: how the paper should be structured
- `specs/thesis-draft/tasks.md`: execution checklist
- `specs/thesis-draft/chapters.md`: section-scoped SDD constraints
- `specs/thesis-draft/chapter-routing.md`: prompt routing for targeted chapter edits

## How to Use

1. Finalize topic/title in `manuscript.tex`.
2. Update acceptance criteria in `requirements.md` if project rules change.
3. Keep section strategy in `design.md` aligned with your target venue.
4. Work task-by-task from `tasks.md`.
5. Compile and self-audit before each milestone.
