# Writing Constraints (Source of Truth)

This file is the canonical rule set for thesis drafting in this repository.

## Abstract

- 200-250 words.
- Must answer: Why / What / How / So What.
- No citation numbers (e.g., `[1]`).
- Avoid vague claims; prefer concrete, verifiable wording.

## Introduction

- Funnel structure: background -> gap -> approach -> contributions.
- At least 3 research contributions.
- Contributions must be academic/technical, not trivial implementation tasks.
- For multi-author narrative citation, use `et al.~`.

## Related Work / Preliminaries

- Related Work must be categorized and critical (not paper-by-paper listing).
- Preliminaries must define notation, structures, and formal problem statement
  in Given / Find / Such that form.

## Proposed Algorithm

- Include system overview.
- Explain core strategy.
- Include pseudocode using `algorithm` + `algpseudocode`.
- Keep variable names consistent with definitions.
- Include time and space complexity analysis.

## Example / Experiments / Conclusion

- Include illustrated toy example with step-by-step states.
- Experiments must include setup, datasets, metrics, baselines.
- Analysis must explain causes, not only observations.
- Conclusion must include limitations and future work.

## Citation and Labeling

- Prefer `\cref{...}` for cross-references.
- Label prefixes: `fig:`, `tab:`, `eq:`, `alg:`.
- Prefer vector figures (PDF) generated by scripts.

## Quality and Ethics

- No plagiarism.
- No fabrication/hallucinated results.
- No unsupported claims.
- Writing must be explainable by the author.
- Avoid obvious grammar/spelling mistakes.
